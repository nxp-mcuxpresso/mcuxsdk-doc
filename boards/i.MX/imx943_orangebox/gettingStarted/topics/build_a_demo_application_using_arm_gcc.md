# Build a demo application using Arm GCC 

This section describes the steps to configure the command-line Arm GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications. Additionally, this section lists the necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application targeted for the IMX943 series hardware platform is used as an example. However, these steps can be applied to any board, demo, or example application in the MCUXpresso SDK.
