# Running a Demo Application Using Arm GCC

This section describes the steps to configure the command-line Arm GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications. This section also lists the necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application targeted for the MIMX8ULP hardware platform is used as an example, though these steps can be applied to any board, demo, or example application in the MCUXpresso SDK.

**Note:** Run an application using imx-mkimage. Generate and download flash.bin to emmc or flexspi nor flash when DBD\_EN \(Deny By Default\) is fused.
