# Ethos-u-core-software

Arm Ethos-U65 microNPU is integrated into i.MX93 applications processors, enabling developers to create more capable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient ML applications. It improves the inference performance of neural networks and is supported with an open-source driver and compiler. The Neural Processing Unit \(NPU\) targets quantized Convolutional Neural Networks \(CNN\) and Recurrent Neural Networks \(RNN\).
