# Connect LPUART on board to console on PC

To download and run the application, perform these steps:

1.  Connect the development platform to your PC via USB cable between the DBG USB connector \(J31\) and the PC. It provides console output.
2.  Open the terminal application on the PC, such as PuTTY or TeraTerm, and connect to the debug COM port \(to determine the COM port number, see [How to determine COM port](how_to_determine_com_port.md#)\). Configure the terminal with these settings:

    1.  115200 baud rate
    2.  No parity
    3.  8 data bits
    4.  1 stop bit
