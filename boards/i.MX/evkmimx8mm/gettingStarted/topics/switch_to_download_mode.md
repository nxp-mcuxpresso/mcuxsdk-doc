# Switch to Download Mode

The board needs to be in Download Mode mode for UUU to download images:

1.  Set the board boot mode to Download Mode \[ SW1101:1000\[1-4\] \].
2.  Connect the development platform to your PC via USB cable between the SERIAL port and the PC USB connector. The SERIAL port is J301 on the base board.
3.  The PC recognizes the i.MX 8M Mini device as \(VID:PID\)=\(1FC9:013E\), as shown in [Figure 1](switch_to_download_mode.md#DEVICEMANAGER).
