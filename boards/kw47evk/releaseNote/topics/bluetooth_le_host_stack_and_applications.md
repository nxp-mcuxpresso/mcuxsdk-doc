# Bluetooth LE host stack and applications {#bluetooth_le_host_stack_and_applications}

The Bluetooth LE Host Stack component provides an implementation for a Bluetooth LE mandatory and some optional, proprietary, and experimental features. The Bluetooth LE Host Stack component provides application examples, services, and profiles.

Main features supported:

-   Automotive Compliance
-   MISRA Compliance
-   HIS CCM <= 20
-   Advanced Secure Mode
-   Enhanced ATT
-   GATT Caching
-   Bluetooth LE Host GCC Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host IAR Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host Peripheral Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Central Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host Full Host Features Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host Optional Features Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host Mandatory Features Libraries
-   Bare-metal and FreeRTOS Support
-   Bluetooth LE Privacy Support
-   CCC Sample Applications
-   Enhanced Notifications
-   Dynamic Database
-   OTA Support - Sample Applications
-   Decision based Advertising Filtering \(DBAF\) - Experimental feature
-   Advertising Coding Selection \(ACS\) - Experimental feature
-   Channel Sounding - Experimental feature
-   Bluetooth LE Controller main and experimental features and capabilities described below are supported by the Bluetooth LE Host.

    **Note:** For evaluating DBAF and ACS experimental features, replace the Bluetooth LE Host default example projects libraries with the libraries from the *SDK* folder *..\\middleware\\wireless\\bluetooth\\host\\lib\_exp* and enable the features in the application. The Radio Subsystem \(NBU\) Firmware with experimental features is required.
