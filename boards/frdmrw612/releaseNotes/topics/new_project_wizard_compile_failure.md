# New Project Wizard compile failure

The following components request the user to manually select other components that they depend upon in order to compile.

These components depend on several other components and the New Project Wizard \(NPW\) is not able to decide which one is needed by the user.

**Components:** wireless\_framework\_lfs\_config, sdu\_adapter, and sdu.

**Note:** Most of middleware components have complex dependencies and are not fully supported in new project wizard. Adding a middleware component may result in compile failure.
