# Run a demo application using IAR

This section describes the steps required to build, run, and debug example applications provided in the MCUXpresso SDK.

**Note:** IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm version 8.40.2 is used in the following example. The IAR toolchain should correspond to the latest supported version, as described in the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes* \(document ID: MCUXSDKRN\). IAR/Segger still does not support RW61x well. Therefore, contact the support team to get `iar_support_patch_rw610_rfp1.zip` and install the IAR patch before opening the IAR project.
