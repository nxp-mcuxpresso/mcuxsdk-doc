# Run a demo using Arm GCC {#GUID-E2FCBEC4-778F-4F48-B6F8-F28D6865C511}

This section describes the steps to configure the command-line Arm GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications and necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application is targeted for the LPCXpresso55S69 hardware platform which is used as an example.

**Note:** ARMGCC version 7-2018-q2 is used as an example in this document. The latest GCC version for this package is as described in the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes for LPCXpresso55S69* \(document MCUXSDKLPC55XXRN\).
