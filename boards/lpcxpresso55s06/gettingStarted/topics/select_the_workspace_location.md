# Select the workspace location {#GUID-820FE7C9-6BFA-464E-9F0E-6F7D12A626D9}

Every time MCUXpresso IDE launches, it prompts the user to select a workspace location. MCUXpresso IDE is built on top of Eclipse which uses workspace to store information about its current configuration, and in some use cases, source files for the projects are in the workspace. The location of the workspace can be anywhere, but it is recommended that the workspace be located outside the MCUXpresso SDK tree.
