# Run a demo using Arm GCC

This section describes the steps to configure the command line Arm GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications and necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application is targeted for the MCX-N9XX-EVK hardware platform which is used as an example.

**Note:** Arm GCC version 7-2018-q2 is used as an example in this document. The latest GCC version for this package is as described in the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes for MCX-N9XX-EVK* \(document MCUXSDKMCXN9XXRN\).
