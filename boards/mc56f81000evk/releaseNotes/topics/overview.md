# Overview

The MCUXpresso SDK is a comprehensive software enablement package designed to simplify and accelerate application development with NXP's current range of 32-bit Digital Signal Controllers \(DSCs\). The MCUXpresso SDK includes production-grade software with integrated enabling software technologies \(stacks and middleware\), reference software, and more.

Support for the MCUXpresso Config Tools allows easy cloning of existing SDK examples and demos, allowing users to leverage the existing software examples provided by the SDK for their own projects.

Underscoring our commitment to high quality, the MCUXpresso SDK is MISRA compliant and checked with Coverity static analysis tools.
