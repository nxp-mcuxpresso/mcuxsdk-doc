5.  Ensure the option **Redlib: Use floating point version of printf** is selected if the cases print floating point numbers on the terminal \(for demo applications such as `dac32_adc12`, `dac_adc`, `dac_cadc`, `ecompass`, `sai`, `coremark`, `mbedtls_benchmark`, `wolfssl_benchmark`, and for `mmcau_examples` such as `mmcau_api`\). Otherwise, there is no need to select it. Click **Finish**.
