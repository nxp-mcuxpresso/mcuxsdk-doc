# Run a demo using Arm GCC

This section describes the steps to configure the command line Arm GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications and necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application targeted for i.MX 8M Nano is used as an example, though these steps can be applied to any board, demo or example application in the MCUXpresso SDK.
