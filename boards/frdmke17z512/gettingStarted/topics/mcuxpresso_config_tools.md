# MCUXpresso Config Tools 

MCUXpresso Config Tools can help configure the processor and generate initialization code for the on chip peripherals. The tools are able to modify any existing example project, or create a new configuration for the selected board or processor. The generated code is designed to be used with MCUXpresso SDK version 2.x.

[Table 1](#TABLE_E1V_M1C_CDB) describes the tools included in the MCUXpresso Config Tools.

MCUXpresso configuration tools can be accessed in the following products:

-   **Integrated** in the MCUXpresso IDE. Config tools are integrated with both compiler and debugger which makes it the easiest way to begin the development.
-   **Standalone version** available for download from [MCUXpresso Software and Tools](http://www.nxp.com/mcuxpresso). Recommended for customers using IAR Embedded Workbench, Keil MDK µVision, or Arm GCC.
-   **Online version** available on [MCUXpresso SDK Builder](http://mcuxpresso.nxp.com). Recommended to do a quick evaluation of the processor or use the tool without installation.

Each version of the product contains a specific *Quick Start Guide* document in the MCUXpresso IDE Config Tools installation folder. It can help start your work.
