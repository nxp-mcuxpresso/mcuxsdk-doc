FRDM-K22F
####################

Overview
********

Form-factor compatible with the Arduino R3 pin layout.Peripherals enable rapid prototyping, including a 6-axis digital accelerometer and magnetometer to create full eCompass capabilities, a tri-colored LED and 2 user push-buttons for direct interaction, and connectivity for use with Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz radio add-on modules.OpenSDAv2 offers options for serial communication, flash programming, and run-control debugging.The FRDM-K22F is enabled with the ARM mbed development platform, which means you can quickly get started designing with no downloads or installations.
