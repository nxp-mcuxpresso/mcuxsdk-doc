# IEEE 802.15.4 features 

The IEEE 802.15.4 software includes:

-   The IEEE 802.15.4 PHY supporting Thread 1.3.x and Thread 1.4.0 with OpenThread, and Matter over Thread
-   IEEE 802.15.4 MAC supporting Zigbee
-   Simple MAC \(SMAC\)
-   Low-level IEEE 802.15.4 radio mode test software
-   Multiprotocol support \(Bluetooth LE and IEEE 802.15.4\)
-   Experimental support for dual PAN mode \(two IEEE 802.15.4 networks on a single channel or two channels\)

The IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC software implementation is based on IEEE Standard 802.15.4-2015.
