# Build an example application

Do the following steps to build the `hello_world` example application.

1.  Open the desired demo application workspace. Most example application workspace files can be located using the following path:

    ```
    <install_dir>/boards/<board_name>/<example_type>/<application_name>/iar
    ```

    Other example applications may have additional folders in their path.

2.  Select the desired build target from the drop-down menu.

    For this example, select **hello\_world** â€“ **debug**.

3.  To build the demo application, click **Make**, highlighted in red in [\#BUILDINGDEMOAPP](#BUILDINGDEMOAPP).
4.  The build completes without errors.
