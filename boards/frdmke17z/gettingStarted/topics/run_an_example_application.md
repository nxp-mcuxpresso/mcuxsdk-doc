# Run an example application

For more information on debug probe support in the MCUXpresso IDE, see [community.nxp.com](https://community.nxp.com/message/630901).

To download and run the application, perform the following steps:

1.  See the table in [Default debug interfaces](default_debug_interfaces.md) to determine the debug interface that comes loaded on your specific hardware platform.
    -   For boards with CMSIS-DAP/mbed/DAPLink interfaces, visit [developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration](http://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration) and follow the instructions to install the Windows® operating system serial driver. If running on Linux® OS, this step is not required.
    -   For boards with a P&E Micro interface, see [PE micro](http://www.pemicro.com/support/downloads_find.cfm) to download and install the P&E Micro Hardware Interface Drivers package.
2.  Connect the development platform to your PC via a USB cable.
3.  Open the terminal application on the PC, such as PuTTY or TeraTerm, and connect to the debug serial port number \(to determine the COM port number, see [How to determine COM port](how_to_determine_com_port.md)\). Configure the terminal with these settings:

    1.  115200 or 9600 baud rate, depending on your board \(reference `BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE` variable in `board.h` file\)
    2.  No parity
    3.  8 data bits
    4.  1 stop bit

4.  On the **Quickstart Panel**, click on **Debug** to launch the debug session.

5.  The first time you debug a project, the **Debug Emulator Selection** dialog is displayed, showing all supported probes that are attached to your computer. Select the probe through which you want to debug and click **OK**. \(For any future debug sessions, the stored probe selection is automatically used, unless the probe cannot be found.\)

6.  The application is downloaded to the target and automatically runs to `main()`.
7.  Start the application by clicking **Resume**.

The `hello_world` application is now running and a banner is displayed on the terminal. If this is not the case, check your terminal settings and connections.
