# Peripheral driver

All peripheral drivers files are included in the generated project template project. They are same as the peripheral drivers within SDK package.

If some drivers are not used or required, users may delete them in CodeWarrior, or delete them in the *project\_template\_MC56F82xxx/drivers* folder.
