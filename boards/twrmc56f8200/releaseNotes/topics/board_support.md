# Board support

The board folder provides:

-   Board-specific demo applications
-   Driver examples
-   Middleware examples
-   A template project

The demo applications demonstrate the usage of the peripheral drivers to achieve a system level solution. Each demo application contains a readme file that describes the operation of the demo and required setup steps.

The driver examples demonstrate the capabilities of the peripheral drivers. Each example implements a common use case to help demonstrate the driver functionality.

The template project is used as a startup project for users to make their own projects.
