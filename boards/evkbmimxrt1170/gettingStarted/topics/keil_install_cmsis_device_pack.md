# Install CMSIS device pack

After the MDK tools are installed, Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard \(CMSIS\) device packs must be installed to fully support the device from a debug perspective. These packs include things such as memory map information, register definitions and flash programming algorithms. Follow these steps to install the MIMXRT117x CMSIS pack.

1.  Download the MIMXRT1171, MIMXRT1172, MIMXRT1173, MIMXRT1175 and MIMXRT1176 packs.
2.  After downloading the DFP, double click to install it. Be patient when the DFP is installed. It will take approximate 15 minutes for the installation to complete.
