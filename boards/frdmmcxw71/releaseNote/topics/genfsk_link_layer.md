# GenFSK link layer

The Generic FSK protocol enables radio operation using a custom GFSK/GMSK or MSK modulation format.

Main Features supported:

-   Highly configurable packet structure
-   Optimized Sequence Command Set
-   High-precision timebase to maintain network timing
-   Two timer-compare mechanisms for Interrupt Generation and Sequence Launching
-   Hardware automation for packet transmit and receive, CRC and Whitening
-   Up to four network addresses to synchronize to, can be 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit
-   Packet Lengths up to 2047 Bytes
-   Support complex auto-sequence, like CCA before TX, Auto-ACK, TR.
-   Many operating modes can support the sending and receiving of multiple protocol packets, such as IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth LE.
