# Run a demo using Arm GCC

This section describes the steps to configure the command-line Arm GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications and necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application is targeted for the MIMXRT685-EVK hardware platform which is used as an example.

**Note:** ARMGCC version 8-2019-q3 is used as an example in this document. The latest GCC version for this package is as described in the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes Supporting MIMXRT685-EVK* \(document MCUXSDKMIMXRT6XXRN\).
