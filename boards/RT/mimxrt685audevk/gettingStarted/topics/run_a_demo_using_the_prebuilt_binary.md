# Run a demo using the prebuilt binary

This section describes the steps to write a prebuilt binary in the SDK package to the external Flash and boot from the external Flash. The hello\_world demo application is used as an example.

**Note:** The prebuilt binaries are provided for quick evaluation of the SDK and the board. Only parts of the examples are provided with prebuilt binary such as examples under boards/<board\_name\>/demo\_apps and boards/<board\_name\>/usb\_examples.
