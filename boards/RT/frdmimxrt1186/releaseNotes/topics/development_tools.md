# Development tools

The MCUXpresso SDK was tested with following development tools. Same versions or above are recommended.

IAR 9.70.2 does not yet support the MIMXRT1186 device. If you need to build your project using IAR 9.70.2, you must install the corresponding IAR patch.

IAR patch is distributed via [iar_segger_support_patch_rt1186](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/download/e8ca8e655b4a5eeff3d9265ef11fa3f2).

Segger J‑Link v9.10 has been verified to support MIMXRT1186 devices, and using J‑Link version 9.10 or later is strongly recommended.
