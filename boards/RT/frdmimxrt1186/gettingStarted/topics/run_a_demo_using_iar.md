# Run a demo using IAR

This section describes the steps required to build, run, and debug example applications provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. This document uses `hello_world` demo application targeted for the FRDM-IMXRT1186 as an example. These steps can be applied to any example application in the MCUXpresso SDK.

Both CMSIS-DAP and J-Link debugging interfaces are supported for IAR IDE. Though not mandatory, it is recommended to reset board for each download/debug.
