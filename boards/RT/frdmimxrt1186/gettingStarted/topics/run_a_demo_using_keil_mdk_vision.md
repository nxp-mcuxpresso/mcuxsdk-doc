# Run a demo using Keil MDK/μVision 

This section describes the steps required to build, run, and debug example applications provided in the MCUXpresso SDK.

Both CMSIS-DAP and J-Link debugging interfaces are supported for Keil IDE. It is recommended to reset board for each download/debug. **Since Segger is not ready for FRDMIMXRT1186 currently, 3rd party patch is provided: [iar_segger_support_patch_rt1186](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/download/e8ca8e655b4a5eeff3d9265ef11fa3f2)**
