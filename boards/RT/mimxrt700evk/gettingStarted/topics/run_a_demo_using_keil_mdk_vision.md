# Run a demo using Keil MDK/Î¼Vision 

This section describes the steps required to build, run, and debug example applications provided in the MCUXpresso SDK.

The `hello_world` demo application is used as an example, although these steps can be applied to any demo or example application in the MCUXpresso SDK.

**Note:**

Make sure that the board is configured as XSPI0 boot mode when debugging or running the examples.
