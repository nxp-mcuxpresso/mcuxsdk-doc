# Install GCC Arm Embedded tool chain 

Download and run the installer from GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain. This is the actual toolset \(in other words, compiler, linker, and so on\). The GCC toolchain should correspond to the latest supported version, as described in the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes for MIMXRT700-EVK* \(document MCUXSDKRT798RN\).
