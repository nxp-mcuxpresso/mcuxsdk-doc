# Download the MfgTool

The Universal Upgrade Utility \(UUU\) is an upgraded version of MfgTool. It is a command line tool that aims at installing the bootloader to various storage including SD, QSPI, and so on, for i.MX series devices with ease.

The tool can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mfgtools/releases). Use version 1.1.81 or higher for full support for the M4 image. Download `libusb-1.0.dll and``uuu.exe` for Windows OS, or download UUU for Linux. Configure the path so that the executable can later be called anywhere in the command line.
