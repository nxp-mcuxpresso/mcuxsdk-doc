# Install GCC Arm Embedded tool chain

Download and run the installer from GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain. This is the actual toolset \(in other words, compiler, linker, and so on\). The GCC toolchain should correspond to the latest supported version, as described in *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes*.

**Note:** See Appendix B for Windows OS before compiling the application.
