Overview
********

LPC54018 IoT solution, developed by NXP in partnership with Embedded Artists, is a self-contained, high performance microcontroller solution for development of AWS enabled products. This solution includes an LPC54018-based module with on-board Wi-Fi, and a base board for rapid development and prototyping. NXPs IoT module offers unlimited memory extensibility, and has options to include a root of trust built on the embedded SRAM physical unclonable functions (PUF) and on-chip cryptographic accelerators. And with support for Amazon FreeRTOS on Amazon Web Services (AWS)  the LPC54018 IoT solution offers developers universal connections to AWS.
