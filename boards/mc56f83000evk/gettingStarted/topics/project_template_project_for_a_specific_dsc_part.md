# Project template project for a specific DSC part

For device with specific part number, the easiest way to set up customer own project based on MCUXpresso DSC SDK peripheral driver, is the project template. The MCUXpresso Config Tool generated the project template.

The project template project provides basic MCUXpresso DSC SDK software framework, including startup, linker file, device header file, debug setting, peripheral driver, FreeMASTER, and so on.
