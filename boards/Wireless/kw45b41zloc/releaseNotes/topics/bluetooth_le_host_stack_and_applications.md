# Bluetooth LE Host Stack and Applications

The Bluetooth LE Host Stack component provides an implementation for a Bluetooth 6.0 mandatory and some optional, proprietary, and experimental features. The Bluetooth LE Host Stack component provides application examples, services, and profiles.

Main features supported:

-   Automotive Compliance
-   MISRA Compliance
-   HIS CCM <= 20
-   Advanced Secure Mode
-   Enhanced ATT
-   GATT Caching
-   GCC Libraries
-   IAR Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Peripheral Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Central Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Full Host Features Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host Optional Features Libraries
-   Bluetooth LE Host Mandatory Features Libraries
-   BareMetal and FreeRTOS Support
-   Full Privacy Support
-   NCP Mode - FSCI Application
-   CCC Sample Applications - Controlled Access
-   Enhanced Notifications
-   Dynamic Database
-   OTA Support - Sample Applications
-   Decision based Advertising Filtering \(DBAF\)
-   Advertising Coding Selection \(ACS\)
-   Periodic Advertising with Responses \(PAwR)
-   Encrypted Advertising Data \(EAD\)
-   Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\) - Experimental feature

    **Note:** For evaluating experimental features, replace the Bluetooth LE Host default example projects libraries with the libraries from the *SDK* folder *..\\middleware\\wireless\\bluetooth\\host\\lib\_exp* and enable the features in the application. The Radio Subsystem \(NBU\) Firmware with experimental features is required.
