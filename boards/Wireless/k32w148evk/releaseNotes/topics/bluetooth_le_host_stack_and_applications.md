No support


    **Note:** For evaluating experimental features, replace the Bluetooth LE Host default example projects libraries with the libraries from the *SDK* folder *..\\middleware\\wireless\\bluetooth\\host\\lib\_exp* and enable the features in the application. The Radio Subsystem \(NBU\) Firmware with experimental features is required.
