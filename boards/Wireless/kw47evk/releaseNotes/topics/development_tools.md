# Development tools

The MCUXpresso SDK was tested with following development tools. Same versions or above are recommended.

**SDK 25.12.00 is the final release that includes MCUXpresso IDE support for KW4x devices. Beginning with SDK 26.x.x, MCUXpresso IDE will no longer be supported for KW4x development, and [MCUXpresso for Visual Studio Code](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-for-visual-studio-code:MCUXPRESSO-VSC) will become the recommended integrated development environment.**
