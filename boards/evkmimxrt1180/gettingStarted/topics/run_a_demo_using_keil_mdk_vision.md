# Run a demo using Keil MDK/Î¼Vision {#run_a_demo_using_keil_mdk_vision}

This section describes the steps required to build, run, and debug example applications provided in the MCUXpresso SDK.

Both CMSIS-DAP and J-Link debugging interfaces are supported for Keil IDE. It is recommended to set `SW5[1..4]` to `0001` for both debugging interfaces. It is required to reset board for each download/debug.
