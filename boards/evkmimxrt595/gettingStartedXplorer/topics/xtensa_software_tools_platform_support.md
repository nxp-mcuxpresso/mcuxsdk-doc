# Xtensa Software Tools Platform Support

The Xtensa Software Tools are officially supported on the following platforms:

-   **Windows:**Win 10 64-bit, Win 8 64-bit, Win 7 64-bit
-   **Linux:**RHEL 6 64-bit \(with ‘Desktop’ package installed\)

There may be compatibility issues with other versions of Linux or Windows, especially when using the IDE. Also note that security-enhanced Linux \(SELinux\) is not a supported platform because the OS can prevent different shared libraries \(including Xtensa Tools\) from loading.

For details on platform support and installation guidelines, see the Xtensa Development Tools Installation Guide.
