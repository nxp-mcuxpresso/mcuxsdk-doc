# Maximum file path length in Windows 7 operating system 

The Windows 7 operating system imposes a 260-character maximum length for file paths. When installing the MCUXpresso SDK, place it in a directory close to the root to prevent file paths from exceeding the maximum character length specified by the Windows operating system. The recommended location is the *C:\\<folder\>*.
