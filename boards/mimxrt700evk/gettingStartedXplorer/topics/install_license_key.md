# Install License Key

Xtensa development tools use FLEXlm for license management. FLEXlm licensing is required for tools such as the Xtensa Xplorer IDE, Xtensa C and C++ compiler.

Currently RT700 supports node-locked license for Xtensa tools. A node-locked license permits tools to run on a specific computer, tied to the MAC address of the primary network interface permanently attached to the machine.
