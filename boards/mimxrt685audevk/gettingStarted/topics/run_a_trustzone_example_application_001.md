# Run a TrustZone example application

When running a TrustZone application, the same prerequisites for J-Link/J-Link OpenSDA firmware, and the serial console as for the single core application, apply, as described in *Section 6.3, "Run an example application‚Äù*.

To download and run the TrustZone application, perform steps 1 to 10, as described in *Section 5.3, "Run an example application"*. These steps are common for both single core and TrustZone applications in Arm GCC.

Then, run these commands:

1.  `arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe`
2.  `target remote localhost:2331`
3.  `monitor halt`
4.  `monitor exec SetFlashDLNoRMWThreshold = 0x20000`
5.  `load <install\_dir\>/boards/evkmimxrt685/trustzone\_examples/hello\_world/hello\_world\_ns/armgcc/debug/hello\_world\_ns.elf`
6.  `load <install\_dir\>/boards/evkmimxrt685/trustzone\_examples/hello\_world/hello\_world\_s/armgcc/debug/hello\_world\_s.elf`
7.  `monitor reset`

The application is now downloaded and halted at the watchpoint. Execute the `monitor go` command to start the demo application.
