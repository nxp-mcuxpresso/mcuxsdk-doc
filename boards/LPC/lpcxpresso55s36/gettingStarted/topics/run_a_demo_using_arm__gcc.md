# Run a demo using Arm® GCC

This section describes the steps to configure the command line Arm® GCC tools to build, run, and debug demo applications and necessary driver libraries provided in the MCUXpresso SDK. The `hello_world` demo application is targeted for the LPCXpresso55S36 hardware platform which is used as an example.

**Note:** Arm GCC version 7-2018-q2 is used as an example in this document. The latest GCC version for this package is as described in the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes for LPCXpresso55S36* \(document MCUXSDKLPC553XRN\).
