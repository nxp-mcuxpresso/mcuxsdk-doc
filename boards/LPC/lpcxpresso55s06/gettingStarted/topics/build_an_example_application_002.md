# Build an example application {#GUID-151EFC23-F84E-4EB4-8940-5A8E58C7E348}

Do the following steps to build the `hello_world` example application.

1.  Open the desired demo application workspace. Most example application workspace files can be located using the following path:

    ```
    <install_dir>/boards/<board_name>/<example_type>/<application_name>/iar
    ```

    Using the LPCXpresso55S69 hardware platform as an example, the `hello_world` workspace is located in:

    ```
    <install_dir>/boards/lpcxpresso55s69/demo_apps/hello_world/iar/hello_world.eww
    ```

    Other example applications may have additional folders in their path.

2.  Select the desired build target from the drop-down menu.

    For this example, select **hello\_world** â€“ **debug**.
