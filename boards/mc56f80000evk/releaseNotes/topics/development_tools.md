# Development tools

MCUXpresso DSC SW and tools contains three parts: DSC SDK SW package, Config Tool, and CodeWarrior IDE.

MCUXpresso Config Tool is capable of generating a template CodeWarrior project for any specific DSC chip part out of corresponding SDK package. Users can start development from this generated template project which includes all the necessary startup files, linker files, drivers, freemaster middleware, and config tool file. For details, see *Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for MC56F80000-EVK* \(document MCUXSDKMC56F80000GSUG\).

The MCUXpresso DSC SDK 2.16.000 is compiled and tested with these development tools:

-   CodeWarrior IDE v11.2 and CodeWarrior for DSC v11.2 SP1 \(Service Pack\)

-   Config tool v16
