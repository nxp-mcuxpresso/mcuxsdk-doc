# Switch to Download mode

The board needs to be in Download mode for UUU to download images:

1.  Set the board boot mode to Download mode \[SW5\[1:4\] = 1100\].
2.  Connect the development platform to your PC via USB cable between the DBG USB connector \(J26\) and the PC USB connector.
3.  Connect J7 \(USB1\) to PC USB connector for downloading.
4.  The PC recognizes the i.MX 93 device as \(VID:PID\)=\(1FC9:0146\), as shown in [Figure 1](switch_to_download_mode.md#DEVICEMANAGER).
