# Run a demo using MCUXpresso IDE

**Note:** Ensure that the MCUXpresso IDE toolchain is included when generating the MCUXpresso SDK package.

This section describes the steps required to configure MCUXpresso IDE to build, run, and debug example applications. The `hello_world` demo application targeted for the `MCXW72X` hardware platform is used as an example, though these steps can be applied to any example application in the MCUXpresso SDK.
