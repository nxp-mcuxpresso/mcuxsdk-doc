####################

Overview
********

The MCXW72 LOC is an IIOT evaluation kit development board for advanced development of the MCXW72 wireless MCU. It offers exhaustive evaluation of the MCX W72's multiprotocol wireless support for Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, Thread and Matter and CAN connectivity.
The MCXW72's highly sensitive, optimized 2.4 GHz radio features is featured with dual antenna diversity via RF switch which can be bypassed to test via SMA RF connection.
This localization platform is dedicated to Bluetooth Channel Sounding Ranging solution development with a dedicated on-chip Localization Compute Engine to reduce ranging latency.
The board includes an advanced MCU-Link debug probe, Power and low power option, dual CAN transceiver, buttons, switches, LEDs and a MikroE Click connector.
