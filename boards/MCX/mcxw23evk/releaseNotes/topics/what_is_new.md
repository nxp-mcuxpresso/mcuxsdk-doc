# What is new

The following changes have been implemented compared to the previous SDK release version \(26.03.00-pvw2\).

- **Bluetooth Synopsys controller**
    - Fix scan response not always sent when filtering duplicates is enabled
    - Avoid network privacy if Peer IRK is all zero
    - Take also SID into account when adding a unique entry in the periodic advertiser list
    - Reject peer random static addresses in the resolving list when it does not contain 11 as MSb

- **Bluetooth LE**
    - **Major Changes**
        - Added support for switching to the coded PHY mode.
    - **Minor Changes**
        - [PSA] Added the project_segment Kconfig option to enable selection of an optimized PSA configuration for Bluetooth LE applications.

- **Connectivity Framework**

    - **Major Changes**
        - [NVM] Enhanced robustness of NVM MIT (Meta Information Tag) operations with improved validation and error handling. Added checksum validation feature controlled by `gNvmMetaCheckSum_d` compilation switch. Systematically validates MIT fields before use and triggers page switch if corruption detected. Fixed `mNvTableSizeInFlash` tracking when table entries are modified. Refactored `NvWriteRecord()` and added `NvModuleSwitchPage()` for better ECC fault handling. Added `NvSetChecksumEnable()` API to control feature at runtime. The feature is disabled by default.
        - [SecLib_RNG] Refactored SecLib mutex declaration and made Lock/Unlock functions public. Changed return type from `osa_status_t` to `secResultType_t` for SecLib mutex functions and moved mutex Lock/Unlock function declarations to SecLib.h.
        - [SecLib_RNG][PSA] Activated PSA opaque execution with s200 and its secure key storage. Switched from PSA transparent mode to opaque mode for all functions except `CMAC_LsbFirstInput()` which is currently not supported in opaque version. Optimized `SecLib_psa_config` to fully accelerate all `PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR` functions.

    - **Minor Changes**
        - [wireless_mcu][ble] Refactored `PLATFORM_SetBleMaxTxPower()` API moved from platform file to `fwk_platform_ble.c` for Zephyr compatibility.
        - [wireless_mcu] Modified `PLATFORM_GetBDAddr()` to return consistent address across calls when `gPlatformUseHwParameter_d` is disabled.
        - [Common] Enhanced external flash API with C++ compatibility by adding extern "C" guards.
        - [platform] Added platform abstraction macros `PLATFORM_GET_IPSR`, `PLATFORM_SET_INT_MASK`, and `PLATFORM_CLEAR_INT_MASK` to allow platform-specific customization of IPSR read and interrupt mask functions while maintaining backward compatibility.

    - **Bug Fixes**
        - [OTA][Coverity] Sanitized the `pImageOffset` parameter in OTA functions to avoid possible overflow.
        - [SecLib] Fixed multiplication buffer pointer initialization for segmented ECDH operations. Fixed EC P256 multistep operations using SW legacy library. Fixed `ECDH_P256_ComputeDhKeySeg()` and `ECDH_P256_GenerateKeysSeg()` argument checking across SecLib variants. Fixed `SecLib_AES_CMAC_PRF_128()` behavior for SecLib sss variant that tolerated VK length to be 0. Removed unreachable code from `SecLib_HMAC_SHA256_Finish()`.
        - [NVM] Fixed initialization procedure in `InitNVMConfig()` to validate `start_addr` and `partition_size`.
        - [SecLib_RNG] Corrected copyright header in `seclib.c`.
        - [MISRA] Various MISRA and CERT-C compliance fixes in NVM module.
