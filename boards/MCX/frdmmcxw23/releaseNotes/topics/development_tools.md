# Development tools

The MCUXpresso SDK was tested with following development tools. Same versions or above are recommended.

**Currently, the new MCX W23 product does not natively support the IAR toolchain.
This patch provides all the required files to your IAR Embedded Workbench installation, enabling you to build and debug MCX W23 SDK projects in the IDE.
The following patch has been tested with IAR Embedded Workbench v9.60.4.
IAR patch is distributed via [https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/download/dceae9212840ef0af4cc0bc6c84f6f9b). Download the archive file iar_support_patch_mcxw23x_25_09_00.zip. Then, unzip the file and copy the content into your IAR folder structure \(typically within *C:/Program Files/IAR* systems\).**
