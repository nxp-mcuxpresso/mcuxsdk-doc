MCX-W71-EVK
####################

Overview
********

The MCXW71 EVK is an IIOT evaluation kit development board for advanced development of the MCX W71 wireless MCU. It offers exhaustive evaluation of the MCX W71's multiprotocol wireless support for Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, Thread and Matter and CAN connectivity.
The MCXW71 highly sensitive, optimized 2.4 GHz radio features a PCB meandered-antenna which can be bypassed to test via Âµ-RF connection.
The MCXW71 EVK is a modular platform composed of the connectivity mother board KW-MCXW-EVK-MB and an M.2 meandered antenna module MCXW71-M10.
The board includes an advanced  MCU-Link debug probe, Power and low power option, CAN transceiver, buttons, switches, LEDs and integrated sensors, Arduino shield connectors, a MikroE Click connector and other headers.
