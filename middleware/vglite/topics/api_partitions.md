# API function group

The VGLite Graphics API has been designed to have independent function groups. It is permissible for a user to use only one of the function groups in the VGLite application:

-   **Initialization** is used for initializing hardware and software structures
-   **Blit API** is used for the raster part of rendering
-   **Draw API** is used for 2D vector-based draw operations
