# VGLite API version 2.0 to 3.0 migration guide

The VGLite API version 3.0 is not fully compatible with VGLite API version 2.0. VGLite API version 3.0 includes some new API functions for the new features in the latest VG GPU like GC555. Some VGLite API version 2.0 function interfaces are changed in API version 3.0. So, the existing VGLite API version 2.0 applications must be modified to compile and run properly with the VGLite API version 3.0 driver. This chapter provides guidance for migrating VGLite API version 2.0 applications to VGLite API version 3.0.
