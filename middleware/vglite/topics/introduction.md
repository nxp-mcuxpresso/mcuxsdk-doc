# Introduction

The VGLite Graphics API \(Application Programming Interface\) is designed to support 2D vector and 2D raster-based operations for rendering the interactive user interface that may include menus, fonts, curves, and images. The goal is to provide the maximum 2D vector/raster rendering performance, while keeping the memory footprint to the minimum.
