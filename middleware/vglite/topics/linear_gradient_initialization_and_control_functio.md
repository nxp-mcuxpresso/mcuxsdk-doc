# Linear gradient initialization and control functions

This part of the API performs linear gradient operations.

A color gradient \(color progression, color ramp\) is a smooth transition between a set of colors \(color stops\) that is done along a line \(linear, or axial color gradient\) or radially, along concentric circles \(radial color gradient\). The color transition is done by linear interpolation between two consecutive color stops.



**Note:** VGLite supports linear color gradients for `GCNanoLiteV` and `GCNanoUltraV`. Both linear and radial gradients are supported with GC355 and GC555.
