# vg\_lite\_enable\_scissor / vg\_lite\_disable\_scissor API

The VGLite API `vg_lite_enable_scissor()` and `vg_lite_disable_scissor()` functions are valid only for `vg_lite_scissor_rects()` API. They have no effect for `vg_lite_set_scissor()` in VGLite API version 3.0.

Although the behavior of `vg_lite_enable_scissor()` and `vg_lite_disable_scissor()` is changed in VGLite API version 3.0, there is no need to change these functions in VGLite API version 2.0 applications to work with the VGLite API version 3.0 driver.
