# Using MCUXpresso Config Tools

MCUXPresso Config tools provide user-friendly way for configuration of the hardware initialization of your projects. This guide explains basic workflow with the MCUXpresso SDK west build system and the Config Tools.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Repository SDK workspace initialized OR Repository-Layout SDK Package extracted
- MCUXpresso Config Tools Standalone installed
- MCUXpresso SDK Project that can be succesfully built

## Board Files

MCUXpresso Config Tools allow to generate source files for the board, such as pin_mux.c/h, clock_config.c/h containing initialization code functions that reflects the hardware configuration in the Config Tools.
Within the SDK codebase, these files are specific for board and either shared by multiple example projects or specific for one example.
You can open or import the configuration from SDK project in the Config Tools and customize the settings to match your custom board or specific project use case and re-generate the code. See the User guide of the MCUXpresso Config tools for details.

Note: Please note that when you open the configuration for the SDK example projects, you may be editing board files that 
      are shared by multiple examples. To ensure you have your own copy of the board configuration files, we recommend to  create the freestanding project with copied board files.

## Visual Studio Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code, we recommend opening the configuration of the Config Tools from there via the context menu for the project. Othwerwise, it's possible to use manual workflow via the steps in the following section.

## Manual Workflow

Use the following steps:

1. Before using config tools, run the west command to get the project information for 
   Config tools from the SDK project files, for example:
   ```
   west cfg_project_info -b lpcxpresso55s69 ...mcuxsdk/examples/demo_apps/hello_world/ -Dcore_id=cm33_core0
   ```
   This results in creation of the project information json file that is searched by the config tools when the configuration is created. The parameters of the command should match the build parameters that will be used for the project.

2. Launch the MCUXpresso Config Tools and in the **Start development** wizard, select **Create a new configuration** based on the existing IDE/Toolchain project, and select the created "cfg\_tools" subfolder as a project folder \(for example: ...`mcuxsdk/examples/demo_apps/hello_world/cfg_tools/`\).


### Updating the SDK West project

Changes in the Config tools generated source code modules may require adjustments to the toolchain project to ensure successful build. These changes may mean, for example, adding the newly generated files, adding include paths, required drivers, or other SDK components.
This section describes how to mnanually resolve the changes needed in the project within the toolchain projects based on the SDK project that is managed by the West tool.

After the configuration in the Config Tools is finished, it's necessary to write updated files to the disk using the 'Update Code' command. The written files include a json file with the required changes for the toolchain project. 

To resolve the changes in the project in the terminal, launch the west command that updates the project. For example:
   ```
   west cfg_resolve -b lpcxpresso55s69 ...mcuxsdk/examples/demo_apps/hello_world/ -Dcore_id=cm33_core0
   ```
   This command updates appropriate cmake and kconfig files to address the changes needed and the application can be built.
