# On-board debugger OSJTAG

An on-board OSJTAG debug circuit provides a JTAG interface and a power supply input through a single micro-USB connector. It is a hardware interface that allows PC software to debug and program a target processor through its debug port.

**The host driver must be installed before debugging.**
