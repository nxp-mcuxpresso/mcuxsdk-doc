# Build an example application

To build the `hello_world` example application, perform the following example steps:

1.  Launch CodeWarrior and in the workspace launcher, choose a workspace which holds the projects to use. If the dialogue box does not pop up, enter a workspace folder and create one workspace.
    ![](/gsd/package/images/codewarrior_workspace_launcher_view.jpg "Workspace launcher view")

    Then the CodeWarrior Development Studio workspace with empty projects appears.
    ![](/gsd/package/images/codewarrior_development_studio_view.jpg "CodeWarrior development studio view")

2.  Import the project into the workspace.
    Click **Import project** in the **Commander** pane. A form pops up. Click **Browse** to the SDK install directory.
    Take TWR-MC56F8400 SDK as an example, all available demo projects are shown. Select the `hello_world` project in the list and click **Finish**.

    **NOTE**
      - If you already know the project location, navigate to the folder when clicking **Browse**, and only one project can be seen.
        To locate most example application workspace files, use the following path
        ```
        <install_dir>/boards/<board_name>/<example_type>/<application_name>/codewarrior
        ```
        Take TWR-MC56F8400 SDK as an example, the `hello_world` workspace is located in
        ```
        <install_dir>/boards/twrmc56f8400/demo_apps/hello_world/codewarrior
        ```

3.  Select the desired build target from the drop-down menu. For this example, select **hello\_world** â€“ **flash\_sdm\_lpm\_debug**
    ![](/gsd/package/images/codewarrior_demo_build_target_selection.jpg "Demo build target selection")

4.  To build the demo application, click **Build \(All\)** in the **Commander** pane.
5.  The build completes without errors.
