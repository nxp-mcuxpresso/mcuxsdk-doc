# Security ELE requires ping every 24 hours

The security ELE requires ping every 24 hours, which is mandatory.

Most of RT118x demos donot ping ELE every 24 hours, because those demos focus on the function demonstrate only. It is still MUST to ping ELE every 24 hours if demo run duration \> 24 hours.

Check hello\_world\_demo\_cm33 for example on how to ping ELE.
