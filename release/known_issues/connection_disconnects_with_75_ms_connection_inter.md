# Connection disconnects with 7.5 ms connection interval

When wireless example works as a peripheral, the central role with 7. 5 ms connection interval connects to the wireless example. However, when using the 6th/7th/8th central to connect the wireless example, all the previous connections with the previous centrals are disconnected.

When wireless example works as central and the connection interval is 7.5 ms, the 4th peripheral is not scanned.
