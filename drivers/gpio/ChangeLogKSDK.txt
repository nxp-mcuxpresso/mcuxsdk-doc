@section  GPIO
  The current driver version is 2.5.2.

  - 2.5.2
    - Improvements
      - Improved GPIO_PortSet/GPIO_PortClear/GPIO_PortToggle functions to support devices without Set/Clear/Toggle registers.

  - 2.5.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed wrong macro definition.
      - Fixed MISRA C-2012 rule issues in the FGPIO_CheckAttributeBytes() function.
      - Defined the new macro to separate the scene when the width of registers is different.
      - Removed some redundant macros.

    - New Features
      - Added some APIs to get/clear the interrupt status flag
        when the port doesn't control pins' interrupt.

  - 2.4.1
    - Improvements
      - Improved GPIO_CheckAttributeBytes() function to support 8 bits width GACR register.

  - 2.4.0
    - Improvements
      - API interface added:
        - New APIs were added to configure the GPIO interrupt clear settings.

  - 2.3.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the issue for MISRA-2012 check.
        - Fixed rule 3.1, 10.1, 8.6, 10.6, and 10.3.

  - 2.3.1
    - Improvements
      - Removed deprecated APIs.

  - 2.3.0
    - New Features
      - Updated the driver code to adapt the case of interrupt configurations in GPIO module. New APIs were added
        to configure the GPIO interrupt settings if the module has this feature on it.

  - 2.2.1
    - Improvements
      - API interface changes:
        - Refined naming of APIs while keeping all original APIs by marking them
          as deprecated. The original APIs will be removed in next release. The
          main change is updating APIs with prefix of _PinXXX() and
          _PortXXX.

  - 2.1.1
    - Improvements
      - API interface changes:
        - Added an API for the check attribute bytes.

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - API interface changes:
        - Added "pins" or "pin" to some APIs' names.
        - Renamed "_PinConfigure" to "GPIO_PinInit".
