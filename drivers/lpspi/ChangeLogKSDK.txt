@section lpspi LPSPI
  The current LPSPI driver version is 2.2.0.

  - 2.2.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug in 3-wire polling and interrupt transfer that the received data is not correct and the PCS continous
        mode is not working.

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - Improved LPSPI_SlaveTransferHandleIRQ to fill up TX FIFO instead of write one data to TX register which improves
        the slave transmit performance.
      - Added new functional APIs LPSPI_SelectTransferPCS and LPSPI_SetPCSContinous to support changing PCS selection
        and PCS continous mode.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug in non-blocking and EDMA transfer APIs that kStatus_InvalidArgument is returned if user configures
        3-wire mode and full-duplex transfer at the same time, but transfer state is already set to kLPSPI_Busy by
        mistake causing following transfer can not start.
      - Fixed bug when LPSPI slave using EDMA way to transfer, tx should be masked when tx data is null, otherwise in
        3-wire mode which tx/rx use the same pin, the received data will be interfered.

  - 2.0.5
    - Improvements
      - Added timeout mechanism when waiting certain states in transfer driver.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the bug that LPSPI can not transfer large data using EDMA.
      - Fixed MISRA 17.7 issues.
      - Fixed variable overflow issue introduced by MISRA fix.
      - Fixed issue that rxFifoMaxBytes should be calculated according to transfer width rather
        than FIFO width.
      - Fixed issue that completion flag was not cleared after transfer completed.

  - 2.0.4
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed in LPSPI_MasterTransferBlocking that master rxfifo may overflow in stall condition.
      - Eliminated IAR Pa082 warnings.
      - Fixed MISRA issues.
        - Fixed rules 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 11.9, 14.2, 14.4, 15.7, 17.7.

  - 2.0.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Removed LPSPI_Reset from LPSPI_MasterInit and LPSPI_SlaveInit, because this API
        may glitch the slave select line. If needed, call this function manually.

  - 2.0.2
    - New Features
      - Added dummy data set up API to allow users to configure the dummy data to be transferred.
      - Enabled the 3-wire mode, SIN and SOUT pins can be configured as input/output pin.

  - 2.0.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the bug that the clock source should be divided by the PRESCALE setting in
        LPSPI_MasterSetDelayTimes function.
      - Fixed the bug that LPSPI_MasterTransferBlocking function would hang in some corner cases.
    - Optimization
      - Added \#ifndef/\#endif to allow user to change the default TX value at compile time.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
